# set.h

A simple implementation of fixed sized sets in **C**.

It has the usual set operations: member, insert, delete, union,
intersection, and difference. It does not have set negation since that
implies a universal set.

It is always useful to have a simple set implementation for small
collections of things like command options or other things one might
want to iterate over.
